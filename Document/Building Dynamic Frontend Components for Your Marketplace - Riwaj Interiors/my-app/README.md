# Day 3 API Integration and Data Migration

## Overview

This is an e-commerce store project where the admin can add products through Sanity. It integrates with an API to pull product data and uploads it to Sanity for management and display. The `itemShop.tsx` component, located inside the `myComponents` directory, is responsible for handling the data pull and upload process.

## Features

- **Admin Product Management:** Admin can add products via Sanity.
- **API Integration:** The system pulls product data from an external API and uploads it to Sanity.
- **Component-Based Design:** The data flow is managed within the `itemShop.tsx` component, which is located in the `myComponents` directory inside the `app` folder.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, you will:

- Learn how to integrate external APIs into your application.
- Understand how to interact with Sanity to manage content and data.
- Ga in experience in solving issues and implementing strategies to resolve them during the hackathon.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/ecommerce-store.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-store
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for API integration and Sanity.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Admin can add products through the Sanity interface.
2. The API integration will automatically pull product data and upload it to Sanity.
3. The `itemShop.tsx` component is responsible for fetching and uploading product data.

## Challenges Faced

- **Errors:** There were several errors encountered during the development process, each requiring different strategies to resolve.
- **Data Migration:** Ensuring smooth data migration from the API to Sanity was a key challenge and required careful integration.

## Conclusion

This project provided a great opportunity to learn about API integration, content management with Sanity, and solving complex problems while building a functional e-commerce store.
